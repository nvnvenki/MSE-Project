Goal:
Given a text - something that can have more than a sentence - for example a comment,
substitute the common abbrevations used in the social media parlours 

Steps
1) The work is to be divided among five of us 
   where each student owns a unique fb page

   A time limit of one hour is imposed on every student
   within this time each student goes through the selected page and produces a text file where each line in the  file contains an abbrevation. 

2) Write a program that takes all the text files as input and read each file into a list and perform a union and write the output to the file output.txt

3) Equitably distribute the number of abbrevations and replace the abbrevation with the actual string 

4) merge all the outputs
